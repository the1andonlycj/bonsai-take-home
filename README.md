Install with yarn install, and run with yarn start.

This project attempted to add an "add to cart" function to the app provided, as well as support for a basic storefront that would allow users to select appropriate options.

While I have fallen short on the most complex selections and add to cart features, there are many milestones which I achieved:

- items with singular variants can be added to the cart.
- items which are out of stock (and feature a singular variant) offer an out of stock message.
- once items are in the cart, their quantities can be changed and they can be removed.
- type support is in place for all major features and major variables that are passed throughout the redux store.![CartModal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42457844/159723183-9017394d-e506-427b-8333-e3ddd7c8d756.PNG)
